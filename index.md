## Exploring the Landscape of Degree-Level Apprenticeships

### Call for Participation

Degree-level apprenticeships have been established with the aim to create employer-led curricula and to increase the supply of skilled graduates. However, to date, there has not been a comprehensive investigation of practices across different programmes. The aim of this [CPHC Special Project](https://cphc.ac.uk/cphc-special-project-grants/) is to capture the breadth and variety of approaches across the UK, with a particular focus on the following aspects:

-	identifying practices and curricular structures used in the context of different programmes (e.g. day release, cohort-based approaches, summer programmes, etc.)
-	investigating employers’ motivations for participating in degree-level apprenticeships and the extent to which they differ across programmes
-	exploring students’ individual learning trajectories and paths to these programmes

We plan to submit initial results from this work to the [UKICER](https://www.ukicer.com) and [Computing Education Practice](https://cepconference.webspace.durham.ac.uk) conferences.

To express interest in participating in this project, please complete the following form: [https://bit.ly/cphc-apprenticeship-interest](https://bit.ly/cphc-apprenticeship-interest)

We will only use this information to contact the programme lead for degree-level apprenticeships in computing at your institution with an invitation to participate.
