## Call for Participation

Degree-level apprenticeships have been established with the aim to create employer-led curricula and to increase the supply of skilled graduates. However, to date, there has not been a comprehensive investigation of practices across different programmes.

The [CPHC-funded](https://cphc.ac.uk/cphc-special-project-grants/) **Computing Apprenticeship Landscape Survey (CALS)** project aims to capture the breadth and variety of approaches across the UK, with a particular focus on the following aspects:

- identifying practices and curricular structures used in the context of different programmes (e.g. day release, cohort-based approaches, summer programmes, etc.)
- investigating employers’ motivations for participating in degree-level apprenticeships and the extent to which they differ across programmes
- exploring students’ individual learning trajectories and paths to these programmes

We plan to submit initial results from this work to the [UKICER](https://www.ukicer.com) and [Computing Education Practice](https://cepconference.webspace.durham.ac.uk) conferences.

### Current Status

In the initial phase of the project, we are conducting a survey with academics. If your university if offering a degree-level apprenticeship programme in computing, please complete this survey or share it with the relevant programme head.
